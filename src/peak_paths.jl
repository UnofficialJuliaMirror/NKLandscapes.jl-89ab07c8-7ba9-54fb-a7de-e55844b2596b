We are interested in the difficulty of evolving from one fitness peak to another.  One way that this might happen
is by crossing fitness valleys.  In other words, low fitness genotypes might survive through drift for sufficiently
long to generate mutations in the basin of attraction of a higher fitness peak.  The work of Sergey Gavrilets suggests 
that as the dimension increases, neutral paths between peaks become increasely likely.  However, if these neutral paths
are long, evolution is unlikely to be able to follow them.  So we are interested in paths between peaks which are both
short and approximately neutral.  The non-neutrality of a path might be defined as the sum of the fitness decreases of
steps of the path.  

To be more precise, let g_0, g_1, . . . , g_m  be genotypes of a path.  Let D = f(g_m) - f(g_0) be the net fitness
increase along the path (or decrease if D is negative).  Let F = sum_{i=1}^{m} |f(g_i) - f(g_{i-1})|
= |f(g_1) - f(g_0)| + |f(g_2) - f(g_1)| + . . . + |f(g_m) - f(g_{m-1})|.  It is not hard to see that the sum of
the fitness decreases along the path is  (F - D)/2.

Example:  Let the sequence of fitnesses along the path be 2, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4.  The fitness decreaeses are
(2-0), (3-1), and (2-1), so the non-neutrality is 5.  D = 2 and F = 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 12.  
(F - D)/2 = (12 - 2)/2 = 10/2 = 5.

The "fit diff" cost F of a path between two genotypes in a landscape is the Hamming distance plus the sum of the
absolute fitness difference between successive genotypes.  

Computes minimum "fit diff" cost paths between all pairs of peaks (local maxima) of NK landscapes.
